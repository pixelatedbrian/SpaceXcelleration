Figure out the acceleration of SpaceX rockets during launch using computer vision ML on launch video telemetry.

##### I've been a fan of watching SpaceX launch videos over the last several years.  When the SpaceX team added stage 2 telemetry to the videos I thought that was very cool.  The video telemetry has time, altitude, and velocity. The latter one, velocity, was the most interesting because one could see just how fast the rockets have to go in order to get into orbit. But it also made me wonder what kind of acceleration do the rockets undergo while they're speeding to these incredible velocities.

##### Fortunately my career has provided me the tools in which to satisfy my curiosity on this topic. This project allows one to download a SpaceX launch video and determine what kind of acceleration the rocket had during the launch.  I'm happy to be able to share how I solved this problem and hopefully others find this as interesting as I do.
